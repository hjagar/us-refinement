# Canonical Bash implementations shared by install.sh and update.sh:
#   - build_agent_paths     : populates the AGENT_PATHS array (static entries + dynamic
#                             .claude-* multi-account discovery)
#   - copy_skill_file       : SKILL.md + scripts/ + tests/ staged copy/swap
#   - new_kiro_steering_file: Kiro steering-file frontmatter-injection transform
#
# This file is meant to be sourced, not executed directly - it only defines functions
# and sets no options of its own (the sourcing script's `set -e`/`set -euo pipefail`
# context applies unchanged). `source`/`.` runs this file's statements directly in the
# calling shell, so functions defined here become ordinary functions in the caller's own
# shell - build_agent_paths relies on that to populate the caller's AGENT_PATHS array
# (bash has no clean way to "return" an array, so it is treated as a global by
# convention, same as the pre-unification inline code did), and new_kiro_steering_file
# relies on $HOME, which is already a normal exported environment variable visible
# everywhere with no scoping concerns.
#
# Distribution timing (see CLAUDE.md "Installers" section for the full constraint):
# install.sh sources this file from $SRC_DIR in local mode (a real checkout, always
# available on disk) or from $CENTRAL_DIR in global mode - but only AFTER the release ZIP
# has been downloaded and extracted there. install.sh itself ships as a single
# self-contained file for the `curl <url> | bash` distribution path and cannot source
# anything before that extraction happens, since no sibling files exist yet at that
# point. update.sh always runs from a real central-store checkout; it refreshes this file
# from the newly-downloaded release ZIP alongside scripts/ and tests/, then sources the
# refreshed copy.

# Builds the AGENT_PATHS array (static entries + dynamic .claude-* multi-account
# discovery). Requires $HOME to be set, which it always is.

# Kiro Steering File Helper

# steering file at ~/.kiro/steering/us-refinement.md with `inclusion: always` injected as
# the first key inside SKILL.md's YAML frontmatter. No scripts/ or tests/ payload - steering
# files are plain markdown only. Stages then swaps into place for the same atomicity
# guarantee as copy_skill_file.
